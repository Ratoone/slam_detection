# SLAM Detection
SLAM and object detection from video. This is a project for the university course 2D and 3D Scene Analysis

To properly run this algorithm, calibration images should be available at ../images/calibration. Also, the source video
should also be present at ../images/MVI_3820.MP4.
```TODO: add these to some config file or terminal parameters```.

Also, the yolov3 model, along with the COCO labels should be downloaded.

This project relies on OpenCV 4.2.0.
